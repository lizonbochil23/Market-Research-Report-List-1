<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Frame Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Valve</li><li>Biological Tissue Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valve frame market encompasses two main types: mechanical valves and biological tissue valves. Mechanical valves, made from durable materials like metals or polymers, offer longevity and are typically used in younger patients. However, they require lifelong anticoagulation therapy to prevent blood clots. Conversely, biological tissue valves, derived from animal or human tissues, provide a more natural function and often do not require long-term anticoagulation, making them suitable for older patients or those with contraindications to anticoagulation. Both types serve critical roles in cardiac surgery.</p></p>
