<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Erectile Dysfunction Treatment Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors</li><li>Prostaglandin E1</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The erectile dysfunction treatment drugs market primarily encompasses two types: Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors and Prostaglandin E1 analogs. PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil and tadalafil, work by relaxing blood vessels in the penis, enhancing blood flow, and facilitating erections.

Both classes aim to improve erectile function and enhance sexual performance in affected individuals.</p></p>
