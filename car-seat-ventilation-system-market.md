<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Seat Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blow Ventilation System</li><li>Suction Ventilation System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car seat ventilation system market primarily consists of two types: blow ventilation and suction ventilation systems. Blow ventilation systems create airflow by using fans to push air through perforated seat materials, providing a cooling effect to the occupant. In contrast, suction ventilation systems pull air through the seat, allowing the moisture and heat to escape, thus enhancing comfort. Both systems aim to improve the driving experience by reducing sweat and increasing overall seat comfort during hot weather.</p></p>
