<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiant Floor Heating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric</li><li>Hydronic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiant floor heating systems primarily fall into two categories: electric and hydronic. Electric radiant floor heating uses electrical cables or mats installed beneath the flooring to generate heat, ideal for smaller areas or retrofits. Hydronic radiant heating, on the other hand, circulates warm water through tubing beneath the floor, providing consistent heat across larger spaces and is often more energy-efficient. Both systems offer enhanced comfort and energy efficiency, catering to various preferences and installation contexts.</p></p>
