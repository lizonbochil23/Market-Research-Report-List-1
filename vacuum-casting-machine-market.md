<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Casting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Non-centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vacuum casting machine market is primarily divided into two types: centrifugal and non-centrifugal. Centrifugal vacuum casting utilizes centrifugal force to ensure even distribution of the molten material into molds, enhancing precision and reducing defects. Conversely, non-centrifugal vacuum casting relies on atmospheric pressure and vacuum conditions to pull the material into molds, often suitable for complex geometries. Both methods cater to different manufacturing needs, with centrifugal being favored for high-volume production and non-centrifugal for intricate designs.</p></p>
